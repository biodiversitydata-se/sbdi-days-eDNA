This tutorial is designed to run in a pre-configured cloud environment, with a local setup available as a fallback.

## Option A (recommended): Workshop RStudio environment

A virtual machine running RStudio Server is available in PDC Cloud.
Log in using the credentials provided during the workshop:

[RStudio Server](http://xxx.xx.xxx.xxx:8787){target="_blank"}

### Check required packages

Load `asvoccur` and confirm version:

```r
library(asvoccur)
packageVersion("asvoccur")  # Should say 1.1.1
```

### Check access to example data

Example ASV portal data is available in a shared directory on the virtual machine. Check access:

```r
data_path <- "/srv/course-data"
list.files(data_path)
```

If three zip files are listed, you are ready to proceed.

## Option B (fallback): Run RStudio locally on your laptop

Our cloud environment is being tested for the first time. If needed, you can run the tutorial locally.

You will need to install:

1. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}<br>
2. [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"}
3. the `remotes` and `asvoccur` R packages

To install the required R packages:

```r
install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("biodiversitydata-se/asvoccur")
library(asvoccur)
packageVersion("asvoccur")  # Should say 1.1.1
```

In this option, example data is accessed via a shared Google Drive folder.
