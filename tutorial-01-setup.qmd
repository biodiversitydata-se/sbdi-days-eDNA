*Set up the R environment used in the tutorial, either via the workshop cloud environment or locally on your laptop.*

## Option A (recommended): Workshop RStudio environment

A virtual machine running RStudio Server is available in PDC Cloud.
Log in using the credentials provided during the workshop:

[RStudio Server](http://193.10.159.112:8787){target="_blank"}

Follow the tutorial steps and **avoid creating additional large objects**, as resources are shared. Save your work regularly as an R script. The virtual machine will be shut down after the workshop, so download any code or output you want to keep via the Files pane (More → Export).

### Check required packages

Load `asvoccur` and confirm version:

```r
library(asvoccur)
packageVersion("asvoccur")  # Should say 1.1.1
```

### Check access to example data

For this tutorial, ASV portal data is pre-downloaded and available on the virtual machine. Check access:

```r
data_path <- "/srv/course-data/16S"
list.files(data_path)
```

If two (16S) zip files are listed, you are ready to proceed.

## Option B (fallback): Run RStudio locally on your laptop

Our cloud environment is being tested for the first time. If needed, you can run the tutorial locally.

You will need to install:

1. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}<br>
2. [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"}
3. the `remotes` and `asvoccur` R packages

To install the required R packages:

```r
install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("biodiversitydata-se/asvoccur")
library(asvoccur)
packageVersion("asvoccur")  # Should say 1.1.1
```

In this option, example data is accessed via a shared Google Drive folder.
