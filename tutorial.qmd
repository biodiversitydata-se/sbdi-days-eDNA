This tutorial walks through the main steps needed to integrate ASV portal data in R and explore biodiversity patterns. As an example, we analyse microbial diversity along the Baltic Sea salinity gradient.

## Getting started
1. [Set up the environment](tutorial-01-setup.qmd) — Access the workshop RStudio environment (or run locally)

## Exploration of biodiversity patterns across environments
2. [Prepare data](tutorial-02-prep.qmd) — Load, merge and aggregate data sourced from the ASV portal
3. [Map samples](tutorial-03-map.qmd) — Explore sampling coverage across season and salinity
4. [Community structure](tutorial-04-pcoa.qmd) — Bray–Curtis distances and PCoA across samples
5. [Taxonomic composition](tutorial-05-barplots.qmd) — Taxonomic barplots across salinity basins
