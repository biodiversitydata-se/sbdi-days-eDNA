This tutorial walks through the main steps needed to integrate ASV portal data in R and explore biodiversity patterns. As an example, we analyse microbial diversity along the Baltic Sea salinity gradient.

## Integration of ASV portal data with asvoccur
1. [Get started](tutorial-01-setup.qmd) — Access the workshop RStudio environment in PDC Cloud<br><br>
2. [Prepare data](tutorial-02-prep.qmd) — Unpack, merge and aggregate example data sourced from the ASV portal
